Prompt for Gemini to Create Ad Maiora’s Website Code
Prompt:
I need you to create a complete website code (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) for my business, Ad Maiora, a procurement consulting firm for Indian SMEs. The website should be professional, approachable, and mobile-responsive, designed to build trust, address hesitations, and encourage engagement from small and medium enterprises in India. Below are the detailed requirements:
Website Purpose and Audience
Purpose: To simplify procurement for Indian SMEs by connecting them with reliable suppliers, offering a human-first approach, and showcasing our unique “Most Liked by Clients” feature. The website should build rapport (30%), establish trust (40%), and overcome hesitations (30%) through its content and design.  

Target Audience: Indian SMEs (small and medium enterprises) looking for affordable, fast, and reliable procurement solutions. They face challenges like delays, high costs, and unreliable suppliers, and they value trust, efficiency, and transparency.
Design Preferences
Colors: Use blues (e.g., #1E3A8A for headings) for trust, greens (e.g., #22C55E for accents) for vitality, and whites/light grays (e.g., #F9FAFB for backgrounds) for professionalism.  

Fonts: Use a bold sans-serif font like Montserrat for headings and a clean, readable font like Open Sans for body text.  

Layout: Modern, clean, and mobile-responsive with intuitive navigation. Include a sticky header with the logo and navigation links.  

Logo: Assume a handwritten “Ad Maiora” logo is placed in the header (you can use a placeholder text styled in a cursive font like “Dancing Script” for now).
Content Structure
The website should have the following sections:
Homepage  
Hero Section:  
Headline: “Is Your Procurement Chaos Stalling Your Dreams?”  

Subheadline: “Every delay, every hidden cost, every unreliable supplier—eating away at your growth. Isn’t it time your business broke free from the mess?”
