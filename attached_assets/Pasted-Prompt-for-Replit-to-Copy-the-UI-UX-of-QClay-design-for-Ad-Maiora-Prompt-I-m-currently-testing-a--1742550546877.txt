Prompt for Replit to Copy the UI/UX of QClay.design for Ad Maiora
Prompt:
I’m currently testing a website code (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) for my business, Ad Maiora, on Replit. The website is a procurement consulting firm targeting Indian SMEs, and I’m happy with the content, which includes sections like Homepage, About Us, Services, Contact Us, Blog, Success Stories, and FAQ. However, I want to enhance the UI/UX to look and feel exactly like the website https://qclay.design, while keeping my existing content unchanged. The current code has basic styling and functionality, but it lacks the modern, sleek, and visually stunning design of QClay.design. I need you to modify the existing code to replicate the UI/UX of QClay.design, ensuring the design, layout, typography, colors, animations, and interactions match as closely as possible. Below are the detailed requirements for the modifications:
Current Situation
I’m testing the code on Replit, and it includes:  
HTML: A structure with all sections (Homepage, About Us, Services, Contact Us, Blog, Success Stories, FAQ).  

CSS: Basic styling with colors (blues, greens, whites), fonts (Montserrat for headings, Open Sans for body text), and a simple layout.  

JavaScript: Basic functionality for a Contact Us form (submission with a confirmation message) and some hover effects on buttons.
The current UI/UX is functional but doesn’t match the modern, creative, and visually engaging experience of QClay.design.
Reference Website: QClay.design
If you can access and inspect https://qclay.design, please analyze its UI/UX elements (layout, colors, typography, animations, interactions) and replicate them exactly in my website code.  

If you cannot access the site directly, use the following description of QClay.design’s UI/UX based on its reputation as a creative design agency (known from platforms like Dribbble, LinkedIn, and Webflow):
QClay.design UI/UX Description
QClay.design is a creative design agency’s portfolio website, known for a modern, sleek, and visually stunning UI/UX. Here are the key features to replicate:  
Colors: A bold, modern palette with a dark background (e.g., #1A1A1A or near-black) paired with vibrant accents (e.g., neon green #39FF14 or electric blue #00DDEB) for buttons, links, and highlights. White (#FFFFFF) or light gray (#E0E0E0) is used for text to ensure readability. Subtle gradients (e.g., dark gray to black) add depth to sections.  

Typography:  
Headings: A bold, modern sans-serif font like Futura or Poppins in large sizes (e.g., 60px for H1, 40px for H2) with generous letter-spacing (e.g., 2px) for a futuristic feel.  

Body Text: A clean sans-serif like Inter or Roboto in a smaller size (e.g., 16px) for readability, with a slightly increased line height (e.g., 1.6) for elegance.
Layout:  
Full-width sections with a dark background and a clean, minimalist design.  

Generous spacing between sections (e.g., 100px padding) for a spacious, uncluttered feel.  

A fixed header with a transparent background that becomes solid (dark) on scroll, featuring a sleek logo and navigation links with a hover effect (e.g., underline in neon green).  

Mobile-responsive with a modern hamburger menu (neon green icon) that expands smoothly into a full-screen overlay with white text on a dark background.
Imagery and Visuals:  
Hero Section: A full-width, high-quality background image or video (use a placeholder) with a subtle overlay (e.g., dark gradient) and bold, centered text.  

Other Sections: Use placeholders for large, vibrant visuals (e.g., creative project mockups, 3D illustrations) with a slight hover effect (e.g., scale up by 1.05x).
Buttons and Cards:  
Buttons: Rounded, bold buttons with a neon accent color (e.g., #39FF14) and white text, featuring a glow effect on hover (use CSS box-shadow).  

Cards: Dark cards with a subtle border (e.g., #333333) and a hover effect (e.g., lift with a shadow and neon outline).
Animations and Interactions:  
Smooth scrolling for a seamless experience.  

Fade-in animations for section content as users scroll (e.g., cards, testimonials).  

Parallax scrolling for the hero section background to create depth.  

Subtle hover effects: buttons glow, cards lift, and links get a neon underline.  

A preloader with a neon green spinning animation (use CSS) for a modern first impression.
